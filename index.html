    <h2>An Unexpected Party</h2>
    <p>
      In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet
      hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry,
      bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a
      hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.
